# Green-Computing-Project
## Setup
To run any model and reproduce our results you will need to install:
* keras
* tensorflow.
## File organization
All of the code for EEG is stored in folder Epileptic Seizure Detection/ and for MITBIH is stored Heart Disorder Detection/.
We also provide processed datasets we use in our paper in respective folders. 
## How to run?
Each code we used for this project is organized in the Jupyter Notebook.
For the Research Question 1 files are cnn_test.ipynb, lstm_test.ipynb, rnn_test.ipynb and plot_time.ipynb (EEG and MITBIH same).
For the Research Question 2 files are cnn_min_model.ipynb, lstm_min_model.ipynb, rnn_min_model.ipynb (EEG and MITBIH same).
All of the Jupyter Notebooks display the latest run results of experiments we conducted.
To replicate results just run each of the cell one by one. If any library is reported missing, use pip to install it.
